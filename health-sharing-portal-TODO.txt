# Health sharing portal

## Bugs
DONE - Blank page (uncaught error/null/undefined) when editing drug. Probably because ProtectsAgainst is null.

## Features
Critical:
- Show start, end, pattern and dose of medication
- Link medication to diagnosis (optional)
DONE - Show "ProtectsAgainst" for immunizations
- Suggest ICD11-items for ProtectsAgainst of immunizations

Nice to have:
DONE - Formating of notes
DONE - Give name/description/note to access tokens
- Consent forms
- Improve error messages when trying to perform actions that the user has no permissions for. Currently throws "Could not store ..."-errors and status 500.
DONE - Medication/immunizations: Number of doses and add "Last: " in front of date.

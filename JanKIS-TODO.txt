JanKIS TODO:
- Apply permission checks in API
- Restrict access/disable element in frontend based on permissions
- Consumable order list
- Consumable order page incl. state change and assinging
- Resource order 
- Order overview page (service, consumable, resource)
- Patient hand-over page
- Nursing page (change bandage, add observation, add/remove equipment)
DONE - Bed occupancy timeline view


Health Sharing Portal TODO:
DONE - Store and display diagnosis
DONE - Store and display questionnaires, e.g. family history, social history
DONE - Specify length of access when creating access invite
- Field for specifying time of observation/measurement in respective forms (default "Now", but when entering historic information the time needs to be specified)

- Idea, medium priority: Have a command line tool for health professionals that can create entries quickly. E.g. "Diagnosis<TAB>Acute Pharyngitis" or "Observation<TAB>Pulse<TAB>84" (with auto-complete). Maybe even skip "Diagnosis/Observation" and recognize disease names and observation names directly?
- Idea, low priority: Give access to institution. Associate health professional with institution -> Connection to JanKIS. Needs further elaboration.
